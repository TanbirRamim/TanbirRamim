### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Tanbir Ramim
#### I am a Front-End developer, trying to become a full stack one.


A decent freelance software engineer from Bangladesh. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

Skills:  REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
